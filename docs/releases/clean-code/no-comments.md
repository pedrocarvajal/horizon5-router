# No Comments Policy

Code should be self-explanatory through proper structure, naming, and design. Comments are not necessary and should be avoided.

## Why No Comments

- Well-written code explains itself
- Comments often become outdated and misleading
- Clear variable and function names eliminate the need for explanation
- Proper code structure makes logic obvious
- Type hints and proper data structures enhance clarity

## Exceptions

Comments are acceptable in the following cases:

- **Section separators**: Visual markers for class organization
  ```python
  # ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # SECTION NAME
  # ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  ```
- **Complex mathematical formulas** with references: `# Kelly Criterion: f = (bp - q) / b`
- **User-requested comments**: When explicitly asked to add comments
- **Pre-existing comments**: Do not remove comments that already exist in the codebase
